# Sky-Sentry
Sky Sentry is a software leveraging SDR technology for airspace defense. Powered by the pyhackrf library and written in Python, it detects and neutralizes unauthorized drones. It ensures airspace security by intelligently jamming drone signals. Safeguard your surroundings with live visual detection using OpenCV. Sky Sentry is also trained on multiple sets of drone models, covering a wide range of frequencies.

- Successfully detected and jammed an off-the-shelf quadcopter drone. 
- Currently developing a modular UI for the system.
